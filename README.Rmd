# Bayesian Data Analysis (STÃ†529M)


Here I will post content for the course in Bayesian data analysis at the University of Iceland.

In the folder [assignments](https://github.com/bgautijonsson/hagnytbayesisktolfraedilikon/tree/master/assignments) you can find Quarto documents that you can use to fill in your answers and render documents to turn in. 

I would recommend you look at the following materials to acquaint yourselves with the use of Git, Github and Quarto:
