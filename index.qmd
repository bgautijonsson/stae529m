### Bayesian Data Analysis (STÃ†529M)

This page contains Quarto templates for the assignments as well as solutions when they have been made available.

On each assignment/solution's page there is a button that can be clicked in order to download the template for that assignment/solution. The student can then write their solution into the premade Quarto template and render it to HTML for turnin if they wish.

### Quarto

All of the templates are written usen Quarto Markdown Documents *(.qmd)*. Quarto is basically the same as RMarkdown so you should not have a hard time switching over to using Quarto. The good thing about Quarto is that you can easily use it to create website. This website was created using Quarto, for example. 

I would recommend you look at the following materials to acquaint yourselves with the use of Quarto:

* [**The Quarto Webpage**](https://quarto.org)

### GitHub

This whole page is built from a GitHub repository at https://github.com/bgautijonsson/stae529m. Instead of manually downloading each file you can clone the repository and pull the contents regularly to your computer to receive the newest versions of all documents.

Git, GitHub and version control in general are essential skills so I would recommend you practice their use.

I recommend the following material to get acquainted with Git and GitHub.
