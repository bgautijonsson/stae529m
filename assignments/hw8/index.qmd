Download the marathon data of Section 6.4 from the course webpage. Let $Y_{ij}$ be the speed of runner $i$ in mile $j$. Fit the hierarchical model

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{i1} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma_0^2) \\
Y_{ij} \vert Y_{ij-1} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}\left(\mu_i + \rho_i(Y_{ij-1} - \mu_i), \sigma_i^2\right) \\
\mu_i &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\theta_1, \theta_2) \\
\rho_i &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\theta_3, \theta_4) \\
\sigma_i^2 &\sim \mathrm{InvGamma}(\theta_5, \theta_6)
\end{aligned}
$$



a. Drag a DAG for this model and give an interpretation for each parameter in the model.

---

**Solution:**

---

b. Select uninformative prior distributions for $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_6$.

---

**Solution:**

---

c. Fit the model in `JAGS` using three chains each with 25,000 iterationsand thoroughly assess MCMC convergence for the $\theta_j$.

---

**Solution:**

---

d. Are the data informative about the $\theta_j$? That is, are the posterior distributions more concentrated than the prior distributions?

---

**Solution:**

---

e. In light of *c.* and *d.*, are there any simplifications you might consider and if so, how would you compare the full and simplified models?
