# 2

Download the `airquality` dataset in R. Fit the following model to the data

$$
\mathrm{ozone_i} \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\beta_1 + \beta_2\mathrm{solar.R_i} + \beta_3\mathrm{temp_i} + \beta_4\mathrm{wind_i}, \sigma^2)
$$

Use posterior predictive checks to verify that the model fits well. If you find model misspecification, suggest (but do not fit) alternatives.

# 4

Use the "Mr. October" data. Compare the two models:

![](fig1.png)

using Bayes factors, DIC and WAIC. Assume the Uniform(0, c) prior for all $\lambda_j$ and compare the results for $c = 1$ and $c = 10$.

# 10

Download the `WWWusage` dataset in R. Using data from times $t = 5, \dots, 100$ as outcomes, fit the autoregressive model

$$
Y_t \vert Y_{t-1}, \dots, Y_1 \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + \dots + \beta_L Y_{t-L}, \sigma^2),
$$

where $Y_t$ is the WWW usage at time $t$. Compare the models with $L = 1, 2, 3, 4$ and select the best time lag L.
